~~_16% of the exam_questions about 8-10 questions_~~
*update 22/02/2024*: _according to [this](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/training-and-certification/coming-soon-updates-to-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-exam/) AWS blogpost, Billing, Pricing, and Support is now **12%** weight of the exams instead of 16%_

* [EC2 Instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/instance-purchasing-options.html) are [priced](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/) as follows
    * On-Demand: EC2 capacity billed to the second.
        * Pay for what you use.
        * Use case: Applications are under development, workloads are not expected to run for more than a year, no upfront payment or long-term commitment, unpredictable workloads but don't want to be interrupted.
        * On-Demand Capacity Reservation: It is possible to buy upfront capacity to mitigate against capacity constraints in an AZ.
    * Spot: unused EC2 capacity on sale.
        * Pay the least but no guarantee of runtimes or interruptions. A 2-minute warning is provided via instance meta-data that your application should check for and prepare for shutdown.
        * Use case: Start and stop time of the workload does not matter. 90% savings over On-Demand. When your workload is feasible only at the lowest price points. 
        * Spot price in effect at the beginning of each hour.
    * Reserved: Upfront capacity reservation commitment for long running workloads.
        * Pay upfront with a contract to get discounts.
        * Use case: Save 75% versus On-Demand and willing to pay upfront for 1 or 3 year reservation. 
        * Flexibility: All upfront, partial upfront or no upfront is possible. A contract is required. Provides convertible types at 54% discount - change tenancy, OS or region.
    * Dedicated Instance and Dedicated Host: 
        * [Dedicated Host](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/dedicated-hosts-overview.html): Dedicated bare metal rental and host exclusively for you to install software that have licensing tied to host size.
        * [Dedicated Instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/dedicated-instance.html): Instances run on VPCs on hardware dedicated to a single customer.
        * Use Case: Save 70% off of On-Demand. Software that is licensed based on per-core, per-socket or per-VM. Regulations that require tenancy exclusivity.
        * Dedicated host is a physical server, dedicated instance runs on a host.
    * Savings Plan: Compute usage commitment for 1 or 3 years applicable across multiple compute services.
        * Save up to 72% off of On-Demand.
        * Use Case: For flexibility across various services like Lambda, Fargate, and EC2.
        * This is a billing convenience nothing to do with a capacity reservation.
* Lambda Pricing
    * Computer Time - no charge for times that code is not running.
    * Duration - duration of compute and memory usage while execution is counted.
    * Free Tier - the free tier includes 1 million free requests each month
* S3 Pricing
    * Storage Class
    * Storage - number of items, and size.
    * Data transfer - outbound.
    * Request and data retrieval - number of requests made.
* RDS Pricing
    * Running Clock Hours
    * Type of Database - brand, size, memory class etc
    * Storage - amount of data
    * Purchase type - on-demand, reserved instance
    * DB count - number of instance
    * API - number of calls
    * Deployment type - is it multi-AZ
    * Outbound - data transfer
   ## Pricing, Billing and Governance
    Compute, storage and outbound data transfer is where the costs are for AWS. Data in flight moving between systems. Data movement within the AWS region is usually not charged. Data out of AWS to end user is where the data transfer costs are.
    How AWS Pricing Works [whitepaper](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pdfs/whitepapers/latest/how-aws-pricing-works/how-aws-pricing-works.pdf)

    1. [TCO](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/how-aws-pricing-works/aws-pricingtco-tools.html) 
        * Total Cost of Ownership. Direct and indirect cost of running AWS workloads. How can I reduce my TCO using AWS?
        * Minimize capital expenditures.
        * Utilize reserved instances.
        * Right size your resources.
        * Does not consider Networking or Data costs. No personnel or facilities costs.
    1. [AWS Price List API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/price-changes.html)
        * Query the price of AWS Services using JSON or CSV. Bulk price or individual APIs.
        * Receive price alerts when prices change.
    1. [Application Discovery Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/latest/userguide/what-is-appdiscovery.html)
        * Determine the cost of migrating to the cloud.
        * Plan migration projects and estimate TCO.
        * You can view the discovered servers, group them into applications, and then track the migration status of each application from the Migration Hub console in your home Region.
    1. [Budgets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/budgets-managing-costs.html)
        * Set custom budgets for cost and usage tracking. Alerts.
